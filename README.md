# morse-code

## Description

This project was an attempt to create a morse code translator for my parents to use whenever they like to. It also helped me practice my morse and javascript array handling. This was another project inspired by the movie Interstellar and I am really proud of this stuff. The translator works both ways so if you want to translate english to morse or the other way around, it is completely fine.
